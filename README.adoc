- build.sh: Here you can do all the stuff to prepare the build. Finally, this script will call the docker build command.
- Dockerfile: Normal dockerfile that will be invoked by build.sh.
- entrypoint.sh: The entry point of the container. Allows us to perform tasks when the container starts (like parse environment variables) and print debugging info
